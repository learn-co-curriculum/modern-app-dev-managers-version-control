# Version Control

## Learning Goals

- Briefly explain the function of a version control.

## Version Control

Modern software can have hundreds of millions lines of code with thousands of
people contributing to it.
[This visual](https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/million-lines-of-code/)
showcases just how big modern applications can be. As application complexity
increased, software engineers realized they needed a way to keep track of the
various changes being made to a project, so version control systems (VCS) were
developed.

A version control system:

- Keeps track of the changes made to the codebase allowing us to record how a
  project changes over time.
- Facilitates collaboration by allowing us to track who made changes to the
  codebase, when they were made, and how it was changed.
- Makes it easy to rollback or revert changes to a codebase. These systems can
  keep track of every single change made to a codebase.

## GitHub

A version control system doesnâ€™t usually provide a way to sync records across
systems. This is where services like [GitHub](https://github.com/) comes in.
They can host repositories (folders that store our project) and provide tools
for collaboration. You can check out all the
[features of GitHub here](https://github.com/features).

## Conclusion

We have learned what version control systems are and how they make software
development easier. Any modern software engineering team is likely to use a
version control system in their workflow.
